    "The objective of this script is to extract the road ban data from the available pdfs on the Alberta Open Data website and attempt to build analytics regarding the historical start dates for road bans. The analytics can help people gain a better statistical understanding of when road bans will be in effect and the degree in which it is the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analytics will examine the frequency of effective dates for axles weights at 75%, 90%, 100%. The data will be normalized to the calendar year to provide insight as to how when road ban restrictions come into effect on the calendar year. The assumption is that these bans are based on weather and temperatures which is correlated with the time of the year in which they get placed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further analysis can be done to examine trends over time to see if there are any longitudinal trends regarding the road ban timing over time."

    "## Why is this important?\n",
    "Transportation of goods and services are a critical part of supply chain within the oil and gas, forestry, and agricultural industries. Project logistics and costs heavily are impacted by capabilities of being able to transport necessary equipment to project sites. Understanding restrictions and the timing of information can lead to a better understanding of project risks and aid project planners and managers with tangible data to make better decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Properly understanding project risks can have a significant impact on proper capital management. Being handcuffed by road ban restrictions can lead to project delays and increased costs to either increase truck traffic to reduce loads and/or upgrade and repair roads that get damaged by heavy traffic in poor conditions."
