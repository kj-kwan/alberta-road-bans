# Alberta Road Bans

## Background
As weather conditions change over of the course of the year, the precipitation (i.e. snow, rain, etc.) and temperature have an major impact on the conditions of the roads used for transportation of goods and services. Road bans are typically implemented during the shoulder seasons to protect roads from getting damaged by restricting weight of the vehicles travelling on the road.

Industrial activities requiring heavy loads or equipment are subject to restrictions during this time and results in potential project delays and increased costs. Companies are cognizant of these restrictions and carefully plan around these times being sure not to leave heavy equipment or conduct projects requiring significant traffic during these times of the year.

As these road bans are typically governed by municipalities and highly dependent on temperatures and types of precipitation the local region has been experience, the dates in which road bans can be expected to be put in effect and taken off can vary from year to year. Most companies rely on the experience of their supervisors, employees, and locals to get a rough idea of these time windows. 

## Objective
The objective of this analysis is to determine statistically when certain roads are most likely going to have road bans put on and off. With a statistical description, the window in which operations must cease or be significantly impacted can be quantified and operations and projects can be planned accordingly. Risk of road related delays can be communicated with data backing a particular decision.

## Approach
* Script to scrape the road ban reports from the Alberta Transportation site. (see https://open.alberta.ca/publications/road-ban-list for more.)
* Parse the pdf reports into a format that can be manipulated.
* Clean the data into a form in which statistical analyses may be conducted.
* Analyze the data to determine the statistical characteristics of road ban effective dates in Alberta

## Analysis
